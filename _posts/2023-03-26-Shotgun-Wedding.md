I started late but managed to put something together.  This is a good example that sometimes using physics does not make for good gameplay.

When the robot jumps platforms, it is commited.  You cannot change directions or velocity like other platforms games allow you to do. This was the feedback I got from a few players.  

So in real life, if you jump forward, can you change direction mid jump, like go backwards?
