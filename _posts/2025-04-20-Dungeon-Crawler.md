I had so much fun developing my game jam entry for the annual Dungeon Crawler Game Jam.

In one week I built:

- an inventory component.
- a gear system.
- skills tree.
- spell bar.
- vendor system.
- combat system.
- loot system.

In addition, I experimented with multiple lights and shadows.
I also used my own A* search pathing algorithm instead of a navigation mesh.
