I have created a solution that takes a 3D GridMap from Godot and uses it in my custom libGDX game engine. libGDX unfortunately does not come with a 3D Editor, more importantly, it does not have any 3D grid editors like libGDX has for 2D tile sets.  

KayKit, Kenny and other amazing 3D asset creators have a plethora of 3D tile asset packs that can be used in your 3D games, for free.

Since Godot has a simple GridMap node that allows you to quickly design and create a 3D world using 3D grid tiles, I made a solution that allows you to design your world in Godot and use it in libGDX.

My Godot GridMap for libGDX demo can now be `played` in your browser on itch.io:
