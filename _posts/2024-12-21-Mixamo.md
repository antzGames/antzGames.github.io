I created a video tutorial that explores the integration of Mixamo animations into the Godot game engine, focusing on the specific challenges users face especially with custom 3D character models.

I tried using other Mixamo to Godot tutorials with a custom rigged characters which resulted in  poor results.  I made this tutorial and it uses a simplified approach.
	
This solution does not need Blender or any other tools other than Mixamo and Godot 4.3+.
