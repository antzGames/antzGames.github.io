I have sucessfully ported ODE4J physics engine to libGDX and is compatible with GWT/HTML builds.  This makes it the only real option for using a physics engine for the libGDX GWT/HTML backend.

## Versions

Both ODE4J `v0.4.1` and `v0.5.1` have been ported.

Version v0.4.1 GitHub repo: [https://github.com/antzGames/gdx-ode4j](https://github.com/antzGames/gdx-ode4j)

Version v0.5.1 GitHub repo: [https://github.com/antzGames/ode4j](https://github.com/antzGames/ode4j)

## Where has ODE4J libGDX version been used?

Here are some games and projects and tutorials that have used v0.4.1 of ODE4J for libGDX:
