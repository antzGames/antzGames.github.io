I built a buoyance system for Godot Ocean Waves. I implemented Archimedes' principle, which is a law of physics fundamental to fluid mechanics. Archimedes' principle states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces.
