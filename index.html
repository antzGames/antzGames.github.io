    In one week I built an inventory system, a gear system, skills tree, spell bar, vendor system, a combat system and a loot system.


    In addition, I experimented with multiple lights and shadows.
    I also used my own A* search pathing algorithm instead of a navigation mesh."

    I tried using other Mixamo to Godot tutorials with a custom rigged characters which resulted in poor results. I made this tutorial and it uses a simplified approach.
    This solution does not need Blender or any other tools other than Mixamo and Godot 4.3+."
